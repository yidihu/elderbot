thomson( rthomson) following discussion resource converters assumes) intrinsics. resource converters changed allow destructors caching converted values. several main types resource converters string data type data type string data type data type) string data type usually string data type converter fixed set strings converted data type values. often used map enumerated names enumerated values name value true 1 false 0 case, string data type converter needs compare resource value list fixed strings. readily accomplished use quark mechanism resource manager. resource value turned quark, unique representation string fits single word. resource quark compared quarks fixed strings representing enumerated values. many enumerated strings converter( many converters, small number enumeration strings, global initialization routine might used turn resource strings quarks. way, first time one converters used, strings turned quarks held static variables use next invocation one converters. ii) data type string type converter slightly easier string data type converters since use quarks n't necessary. instead, data type value simply converted string value, probably use sprintf. data type string converters useful applications wish convert internal data type value string write valid resource specification file. mechanism used provide snapshot application state file. snapshot used restore program known state via usual x resource database mechanisms. taking trouble write string data type converter, n't much extra effort write data type string converter. writing time helps ensure consistent. iii) data type data type type converter used convert existing data type value another data type. instance, x pixel value converted rgb data type contains separate fields red, green blue. type signature resource converter follows typedef boolean( xttypeconverter( display, xrmvalueptr, cardinal, xrmvalueptr, xrmvalueptr, xtpointer) display dpy xrmvalueptr args cardinal num args xrmvalueptr fromval xrmvalueptr toval xtpointer converter data converter invoked, fromval argument points source x resource manager value toval argument points destination x resource manager value. converter data argument opaque pointer converter-specific data specified converter registered. args num args arguments allow extra information passed converter invoked. instance, pixel rgb structure converter discussed would need colormap visual arguments lookup pixel obtain rgb values corresponding pixel. care must taken toval argument. xrmvalue following type definition specifies size location converted value typedef struct unsigned int size caddr addr xrmvalue, xrmvalueptr converter invoked, address may point location given size converted value location null. former case, converter ensure size destination area large enough handle converted value. destination area large enough, converter set size amount space needed return false. caller ensure enough space allocated reinvoke converter. size large enough, converter simply copy converted value space given return true. location null, converter assign location address static variable containing converted value return true. writing group converters, code often repeated becomes convenient define macro# define done( var, type( toval- addr( toval- size sizeof( type) toval- size sizeof( type) return false else( type) toval- addr) var else toval- addr( caddr& var toval- size sizeof( type) return true# define donestr( str( toval- addr& toval- size sizeof( string) toval- size sizeof( string) return false else toval- addr( caddr) str toval- size sizeof( string) return true inside converter, good idea perform little safety checking num args args arguments ensure converter called properly. written converter, need register intrinsics. intrinsics invokes resource converters creating widgets fetching resource values resource database. register converter single application context, use xtappsettypeconverter void

xtconvertarglist args cardinal num args xtcachetype cache xtdestructor destructor intrinsics, routines xtappaddconverter xtaddconverter superseded xtappsettypeconverter xtsettypeconverter. whenever possible, newer routines used. converter registered intrinsics, cache argument specifies converted resource values cached xtcachenone n't cache converted values xtcacheall cache converted values xtcachebydisplay cache converted values per display basis caching converted values require round-trip server good idea( instance string pixel conversions. destructor argument routine invoked resource destroyed, either cached reference count decremented zero widget owning value destroyed. xtdestructor following type definition typedef void( xtdestructor( xtappcontext, xrmvalueptr, xtpointer,

remain valid. random' mean cryptography cryptographic applications demand much pseudorandom number generator applications. source bits cryptographically random, must computationally impossible predict nth random bit given complete knowledge algorithm hardware generating stream sequence 0th n-1st bits, n lifetime source. software generator( also known pseudo-random) function expanding truly random seed longer string apparently random bits. seed must large enough guessed opponent. ideally, also truly random( perhaps generated hardware random number source. sparcstation 1 workstations could, example, generate random numbers using audio input device source entropy, connecting anything. example, cat dev audio compress- foo gives file high entropy( random much randomness. one encrypt file using part key, example, convert seed entropy pseudo-random string. looking hardware devices provide entropy, important really measure entropy rather assume looks complicated human, must random. example, disk operation completion times sound like might unpredictable( many people) spinning disk much like clock output completion times relatively low entropy. unicity point(.a. unicity distance) see sha49. unicity distance approximation amount ciphertext sum real information( entropy) corresponding source text encryption key equals number ciphertext bits used. ciphertexts significantly longer shown probably unique decipherment. used back claim validity ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. ciphertexts significantly shorter likely multiple, equally valid decryptions therefore gain security opponentdifficulty choosing correct one. unicity distance, like statistical information-theoretic measures, make deterministic predictions rather gives probabilistic results namely, minimum amount ciphertext likely single intelligible plaintext corresponding ciphertext, possible keys tried decryption. working cryptologists n't normally deal unicity distance. instead directly determine likelihood events interest. let unicity distance cipher characters. fewer ciphertext characters intercepted, enough information distinguish real key set possible keys. des unicity distance characters, less 3 ciphertext blocks( block corresponds 8 ascii characters. may seem alarmingly low first, unicity distance gives indication computational work required find key approximately characters intercepted. fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along lines used discussing unicity distance( like measures key size, unicity distance something guarantees insecuritysmall, n't guarantee securityhigh) practical cryptosystems absolutely impervious analysis manner characteristics might serve entering wedges' crack cipher messages. however, similar information-theoretic considerations occasionally useful, example, determine recommended key change interval particular cryptosystem. cryptanalysts also employ variety statistical information-theoretic tests help guide analysis promising directions. unfortunately, literature application information statistics cryptanalysis remains classified, even seminal 1940 work alan turing( see koz84. insight possibilities, see kul68 goo83. key management important one fundamental axioms cryptography enemy full possession details general cryptographic system, lacks specific key data employed encryption( course, one would assume cia make habit telling mossad cryptosystems, mossad probably finds anyway) repeated use finite amount key provides redundancy eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. thus, especially modern communication systems vast amounts information transferred, parties must sound cryptosystem also enough key material cover traffic. key management refers distribution, authentication, handling keys. publicly accessible example modern key management technology stu iii secure telephone unit, classified use employs individual coded crypto ignition keys' central key management center operated nsa. hierarchy certain ciks used authorized cryptographic control personnel validate issuance individual traffic keys perform installation maintenance functions, reporting lost ciks. give inkling extent key management problem. public-key systems, several related issues, many trust` use pseudo-random chaotic numbers key stream chaotic equations fractals produce apparent randomness relatively compact generators. perhaps simplest example linear congruential sequence, one popular types random number generators, obvious dependence seeds outputs. unfortunately graph sequence, high enough dimension, show regular lattice. mathematically lattice corresponds structure notoriously easy cryptanalysts exploit. complicated generators complicated structure, make interesting pictures- cryptographically

"daveb( dave butler) new biblical contradictions still answered( judas) organization tektronix, inc, wilsonville. lines 180 mr decenso, spite requiring scholarly opinion hanging judas, rejects scholarly opinion scholars rephrases scholars opinion subject. know matthew hang acts probably records death. althoughpossible plausible fell hanging hit rocks, thereby bursting open, longer assume case. therefore, contradiction. matthew say judas died result hanging, scholars believe iprobably, but. quoted show highly regard scholars' explanations, looking texts initially, ca n't assume judas died, however, highly probable. also, nothing greek suggest success failure. simply means hang oneself. actually, research greek word apacgw, find denote success. scholars indeed excellent reason assume suicide successful. pointed, recently checked several lexicons greek english lexicon new testament, louw nida robinsongreek english lexicon new testament greek english lexicon new testament, grimm word study concordance, tynsdale greek english lexicon new testament early christian writings, bauer-arndt-gingrich new analytical greek lexicon, perschbacher couple simply stated hanged oneself, couple explicit stated apacgw means specifically kill hanging. couple also noted meaning one root words apacgw strangle, throttle choke( pretty much invalidates guy suggested david joslin judas hung upside. one best references though, robinsongreek english lexicon new testament, stated translation, gave root words, literal translation, related greek words use roots, also presented specific examples word greek literature( give context. word apagchw two root words gchw strangle root, root word apo means literally away. root words included words denote transition. mean transition place( eg greek word apagello means send message. apo also denote change state specifically change life death. robinson specifically makes comparison word apokteiuo, means kill. literal meaning word apacgw means throttle, strangle put way, implicitly denotes change life state( ie away life, death. word apacgw mean hang, specifically denotes death well. thus robinson quite specific state means hang oneself, end onelife hanging. notes use apacgw homers odessy 19 230 denote context. presents example apacgw used explicitly mean suicide hanging. since perfectly good word strangling, without added denotation death, insist bible written god, every word precicely correct, stuck complete meaning apacgw( ie since word apacgw used, death denoted result. way, note mr decenso also presents example apacgw septuagint( greek translation ot used time jesus,used 2 samuel 17 23 ahithophel saw advice followed, saddled donkey, arose went home house, city. put household order, hanged, died buried fathertomb. notice stated ahithophel hanged gr. sept, apagcho, explicitly adds, died. doubt result. matthew, explicitly told judas died. note mr decenso, say, septuagint translation hebrew greek, shown original meaning hebrew( ie hebrew say died, thus whether simply echoed greek. also pointed, regardless added died, correct translation would still apacgw, man indeed die strangulation( redundant, correct, evidence septuagint repeatedly rewritten reedited( included versions contradicted, editing even necessarily executed greeks. thus sure use septuagint stands, paragon ancient greek, really need prove point mr decenso, example, ancient greek, someone committing apacgw surviving. otherwise would see simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence. would note mr decenso, everytime go way research one apparently contrived exegisis, pretty much find false. thus, think going add text, something source clearly says, better explicit greek historical source justify. way, mr rosestatement trees around potterfield still trees around ledges rocky pavement bottom. unless mr rose show trees two thousand years old, 2000 year old stumps, 2 thousand year old description area mentions trees, inappropriate assert present placement trees prove location trees two thousand years ago, things change. argument, ie money judas used 30 silvers second question mr decenso, ask could sure money judas purchased land, indeed betrayal, rather source. would point acts, specifically mention reward iniquity acts 1 18, also specifically mentions act iniquity talking( ie acts 1 16..ncerning judas guide arrested jesus. would point bible describes act iniquity, immediately discusses reward iniquity, would rather inane suggest action iniquity one discussed. notice verse 16, word iniquity used. rather, states judas became guide arrested jesus. writer stop. vs. 17, numbered us obtained part ministry. part judas play ministry true, peter( author acts) specifically call judas' betrayal iniquity, matter, neither john specifically call judas' actions iniquity either. john 13 29 say judas took money box, rather said thought, judas money box, jesus telling buy need feast give something poor, receiving morsel immediately went, night. note said judas left, say took money box. thus see explanation still seems would choose unproven iniquity, mentioned another author, different book, written different time, iniquity explicitly mentioned author acts. find forced contrived. course particular argument becomes moot, since seen evidence apacgw means suicide. see, since judas' hanging successful, could spent money mentioned john 13 29, matthew mark explicitly say betrayal high holy day( ie passover, thus could spent money killing next day. thus money bought field blood would 30 pieces silver( course got 30 pieces silver night well, thus could n't spent either. oh dear, believe house cards comming. maybe point, discuss whether jesus crucified
